Implement a two-page application to view and choose favorite images made by NASA's Curiosity rover provided by [https://api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/) via their API.

## *Requirements:*

- First page should have an interface with a "swipe" function (left or right) to sort images easily by swiping right to compile a list of your favorite images and left for those you deem as trash. A user should be able to undo the last action by pressing "undo" button.
- Second page shows a list of the favorite images that the user chose from the first page.
